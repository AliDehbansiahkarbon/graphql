Simple implementation for GraphQL, a query language for APIs created by Facebook.

GraphQL is a query language for your API and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.

See more complete documentation at https://graphql.org/.

## Getting Started

With this pre-release of *GraphQL for Delphi* you can explore the GraphQL query and call your API. You can see the demo to have an idea of the capabilities of this library.
